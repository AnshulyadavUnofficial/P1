There once was a man named Steve who really enjoyed eating apples. One day, he stumbled upon a golden apple.
Seeing this apple glean, his mouth started to water and he hurreidly picked it up. His glutonny let him forgo that the apple was unusually heavy and when he tried to savagily take a bite out of it, he broke his teeth.
